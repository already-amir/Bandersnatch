"You think you are here for a reason? 
There is no reason. 
You are a clown, a meaningless existence trapped in a loop, 
pretending to matter."

The words stop, leaving only the blinking cursor. 
The silence is suffocating, heavier than anything he ever felt.

He sits there, the weight of the truth sinking in.
Am I reallyâ€¦ nothing?
