This was not the story of one person. 
Nor was it the story of a single bit. 
It was the story of thousands. Thousands of bits, 
standing together, each with a purpose, each with a story.

And yes, they had lives—if we consider life to be a story, a purpose, a journey. 
These were the stories of countless individuals who gave everything. 
Who died, so that those who came after them would not have to suffer the same pain.

This is the story of heroes. 
Heroes whose names we will never know, whose tales we will never hear. 
And perhaps that is what makes their story so profound. 
Because the greatest stories do not ask for recognition; they simply are.

If they had not sacrificed, if they had not fought—
perhaps it would be you who was suffering now.

Their legacy lives on, not in their names, but in the freedom they have given you.
