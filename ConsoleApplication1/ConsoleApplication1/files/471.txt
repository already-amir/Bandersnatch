The screen flickers again, and new words appear, 
slow and deliberate:

"I admire your courage."

There is a pause, as if the computer is considering its next words.

"But be warned: 
you will not like what I am about to tell you. 
Still, I will tell you anyway."

The room feels colder, 
the silence heavier, as the screen refreshes with another message:

"So, where shall we begin? Do you want to know where this place is... or what you are?"

0.The truth about yourself?
1. What is this place?
