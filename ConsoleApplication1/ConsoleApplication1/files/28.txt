He descends the spiral staircase, the air growing colder with each step. 
At the bottom, a small, dimly lit room greets him, its silence heavy.

On a dusty table in the center lies a gun. 
He hesitates, then steps forward, picking it up. 
The cold weight of it in his hand feels unnerving, 
and for a moment, a dark thought crosses his mind:

"What if it all ended here?"

The idea lingers, tempting him. But he exhales sharply, shaking it off. 
he slides the gun into his pocket and steps away from the table.

0.Kill yourself.
1.Put the gun in your pocket.
