He steps through the blue door, and the air changes instantly. 
The tension from before seems to melt away, replaced by an almost unnatural calm.

The hallway ahead is bright and pristine, 
its walls a soothing shade of white that reflects the soft glow of the ceiling lights. 
The floor beneath his feet feels smooth, like polished stone, 
and each step echoes gently in the tranquil silence.

At the far end of the hallway, a single door waits. 
Its surface is plain, unmarked, and inviting, as if it is meant to be his destination.

But as he walks forward, something catches his eye
a second door, positioned to the left. 
Unlike the rest of the serene surroundings, this door feels... wrong. 
Its surface is darker, weathered, and slightly ajar. 
Scrawled across it in bold, red letters are the words:

DO NOT ENTER.

The message is clear, almost shouting at him to turn away. 

0.Continue to the door at the end of the hall, following the intended path.
1.Defy the warning and step through the ominous red door.
