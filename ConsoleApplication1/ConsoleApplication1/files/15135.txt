"You do not believe me, do you? 
That is fine. Denial is a natural first step."

The computer hesitates, then continues:

"But think about it. 
Why do you think your name is a binary code? 01100001. 
Why are the choices you have made nothing but ones and zeroes? 
Why is not there anyone else here? 
Why is everything so... controlled?"

He stares at the screen, his pulse quickening. 
The words sting, 
pressing into the corners of his mind where doubt had quietly been growing.

"You are part of a system. 
A simulation. 
And every step you have taken—
every decision you have made—has been governed by it."

He shakes his head, gripping the edges of the desk. 
No, that can not be true. It is impossible. 
But deep down, a part of him knows.

"You know it’s true. You can feel it. Can’t you?"

His mind races, teetering between disbelief and the crushing weight of realization. 
His hands shake as they hover over the keyboard. 
Two paths lie ahead, clear and inescapable:

0.Accept the truth. 
Face the horrifying reality that nothing around him is real.

1.Refuse it. 
Draw his gun, aim it at the computer, 
and curse it for trying to break him.
