he pauses for a moment, ignoring the path intended for him.
Against all expectations, he pushes open the red door.

The room inside is... normal. 
Almost unsettlingly so. 
A wooden desk, a single chair, a clock ticking softly on the wall. 
It feels out of place, too perfect, too ordinary.

On the desk, a telephone begins to ring. 
Its sound pierces the silence, demanding attention.

He stands there, frozen for a moment. 
The ringing grows louder, as if urging him to decide.

He decided to ignore it.
