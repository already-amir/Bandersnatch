01100001 hesitates for a moment, then slowly lifts the receiver.
The line crackles with static, a faint buzzing sound filling the room.

"Hello?" he says, his voice uncertain.
For a moment, there is only silence. 

Then, a voice emerges—calm, yet cold, laced with urgency.
"You should not be here."

The words cut through the static like a knife.
"This place... it was not meant for you. 
Every second you remain here, 
you risk unraveling things you can not even begin to understand."
 
"What are you talking about? Who are you?"

The voice grows sharper, more insistent. 
"There is no time for questions. 
You must leave now. If you stay, 
the consequences will be disastrous—for you and for the others."

His breath catches. 
"Others? Where are they? Why have not I seen anyone?"

The voice hesitates, as if choosing its next words carefully. 
"The answers you seek... they are not here. 
But I promise you this: 
if you stay, you will never find them. You need to go back. Now."

The static grows louder, the voice fading into the noise. 
"Go back... before it is too—"
Click. The line goes dead.

he lowers the receiver, the room suddenly feeling colder, emptier. 
The silence weighs heavily on him.

Should he heed the call and return to the hallway? 
Or should he defy the warning and stay to uncover the truth of this place?
