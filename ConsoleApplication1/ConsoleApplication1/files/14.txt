he hesitates for a moment, then slowly lifts the receiver.
The line crackles with static, a faint buzzing sound filling the room.

"Hello?" he says, his voice uncertain.
For a moment, there is only silence. 

Then, a voice emergesâ€”calm, yet cold, laced with urgency.
"You should not be here."

The words cut through the static like a knife.
"This place... it was not meant for you. 
Every second you remain here, 
you risk unraveling things you can not even begin to understand."

He said: "Who am I?"
 
0."What are you talking about? Who are you?"
1."What are you talking about? Who am I?"
