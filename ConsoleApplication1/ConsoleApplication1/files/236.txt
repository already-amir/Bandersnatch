Hours pass, and the room remains silent. 
The door he came through is gone, leaving no way forward or back. 
The computer glows faintly, unresponsive, a constant reminder of his helplessness.

He pulls the gun from his pocket, turning it over in his hands. 
The weight feels familiar now, almost comforting. 
With no hope and no answers, a thought crosses his mind:

"What if I shoot the computer? What if that changes something?"

But another, darker thought follows:

"What if I shoot myself?"

0.Shoot computer
1.Shoot yourself
