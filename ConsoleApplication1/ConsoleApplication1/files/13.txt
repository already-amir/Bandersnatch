He stood still for a moment. 
Taking a deep breath, he pushed aside his unease and walked toward the other door. 
Without looking back, he stepped through.

After a few steps, he reached the base of a staircase. 
The stairs twisted upward into a faint glow, 
while below, they disappeared into complete darkness.

A soft, warm light seemed to call him upward, promising safety or ease. 
From below came a cold, heavy silence, 
like the air itself was waiting for something to happen.

He stopped and looked at the two choices. 
Then he went up toward the light.

0.Go up toward the light.
1.Go down into the darkness.
