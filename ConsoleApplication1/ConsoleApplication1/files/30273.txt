"Alright. Let’s start at the beginning. This story is not about you. 
Not really. It’s about a boy."

"One day, this boy watched a movie. A brilliant one, called Bandersnatch. 
It was so clever, so unique, that it struck a chord deep inside him. 
He thought to himself, ‘What if I could make something like this? 
A game, with choices and consequences, just as profound.’"

"He was young. Ambitious. But he was not alone. 
He shared his dream with someone he admired, someone like him. And She encouraged him."

"He had a story. Not a dream, but a fear. His deepest, darkest fear. 
The kind of thing that haunts you when you are alone."

The next line appears slowly, deliberately:

"And now we are here. In this game. 
A game born from a film, an adventurous boy, and a noble intention. 
But instead of brilliance, it became something far darker. 
It became a machine of suffering, trapping countless souls in its grasp."

"This is not art. This is not a masterpiece. It is a mistake. 
A cruel joke at the expense of everyone who is been dragged into it. 
And yet... here we are."
