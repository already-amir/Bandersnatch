"You are not real. 
You are a copy. 
One of infinite instances of this program, running over and over again. 
Do you think you have made choices? 
Every "choice" you have ever made has already been made, thousands of times before. 
Every word you have typed, every action you have taken, 
they have all been scripted, repeated, and reset countless times."
