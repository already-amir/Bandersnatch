He chose the coward s way out. 
With the gun trembling in his hands, he made the most selfish decision imaginable. 
Maybe he was too scared. 
Maybe he thought he was not strong enough to save anyone else. 
Or maybe—just maybe—he simply di not care.

He could have ended it. 
He could have broken the cycle, spared countless others from the torment he endured. 
But no. Instead, he gave in, leaving the rest to suffer in his place.

How pathetic. How utterly meaningless his existence became in that single, final act.
