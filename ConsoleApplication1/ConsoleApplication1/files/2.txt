*          The story begins here...                 *
*                                                    *
*     You find yourself standing at a crossroad.    *
*     To your left, a narrow path disappears        *
*     into a dark forest, filled with whispers.     *
*                                                    *
*     To your right, an open field stretches wide,  *
*     bathed in the golden light of the sun.        *
*                                                    *
*     Which path will you take?                     *
*                                                    *
*     1. Enter the forest                           *
*     2. Walk into the field                        *
*                                                    *
