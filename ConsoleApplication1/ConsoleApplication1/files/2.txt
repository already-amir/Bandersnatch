he sits quietly, staring at the black void of the computer screen. 
The silence in the room feels heavier with each passing second, 
as if the screen itself is waiting.

Slowly, he rises from the chair, his footsteps soft yet purposeful. 
The room seems to watch as he walks toward the door.

A simple turn of the handle, and the door creaks open, 
revealing a long, dimly lit hallway.

At the end of the hallway stand two doors.
One is painted a deep, intense red. 
The other, a cool, calm blue.

Without hesitation, he moves toward the blue door.
