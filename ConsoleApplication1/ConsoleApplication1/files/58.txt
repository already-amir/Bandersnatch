He turns his head and notices another door, one he had not seen before. 
Faded letters are etched across its surface:

"ONE-WAY DOOR."

He frowns, the words tugging at his thoughts. 
"A one-way door? What does that even mean?"

The door stands silently, its meaning unclear but unsettling. 
He reaches out, his hand hovering over the handle, but something holds him back. 
Whatever lies behind the one-way door, it can wait.

After a moment, he steps away. Turning back toward the staircase, 
he decides to retrace his steps, climbing slowly upward.
