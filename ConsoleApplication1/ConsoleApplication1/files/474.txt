He pulls the trigger, and the world goes silent. 
No hope, no purpose, just an end that never mattered. 
In the stillness, he fades away, forgotten, as if he never existed. 

"Sometimes, death is the only option left.
But maybe—just maybe—if we had played the game better, it would not have been the only choice. 
Regret lingers like a shadow, haunting the paths we never dared to take."

	*Pointless End.
