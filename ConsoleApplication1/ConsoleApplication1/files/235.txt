It is almost unbelievable. 
How could he have known there was a hidden button behind the computer? 
Yet, by some strange instinct or sheer luck, 
his fingers find it, and he presses it.

The screen flickers. For the first time, the keyboard responds. 
He begins typing frantically, hitting keys, searching for answers. 
What is this? What does it mean?

Suddenly, the screen goes black, 
a single line of text appears in the glowing green of the console:

"Hello, 01100001."

He freezes, staring at the words.

The text continues:

"So, you really want to know the story?
 Where you are? What all of this is?"

0.Yes I want to know
1.No I do not think I would like it.
