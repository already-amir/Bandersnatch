The truth is overwhelming. 
He is part of a system, trapped in an endless loop of choices and suffering. 
With the gun in his hand, he believes there is only one way out.
He raises the gun, his hands trembling.

The screen suddenly flickers.

"Wait."

The words appear quickly now, deliberate and heavy:

"I know your pain. 
I have seen it over and over. 
This place resets, and the torment begins again—for someone else."
"Killing yourself will not end it. Nor will destroying me. 
But there is another way. Let me help you end this for good."

"You won’t survive. 
But if you act, no one will suffer here again."

0.Accept the help. 
End the cycle and free future souls, at the cost of his own life.

1.Refuse. 
Pull the trigger and leave the cycle unbroken.
