Curiosity gets the better of him, and he steps through the one-way door. 
The room beyond is dimly lit, its walls bare and unremarkable. 
In the center, a single desk stands with an old computer resting on it, its screen glowing faintly.

He approaches and sits down, his fingers brushing against the keyboard. 
The screen shows lines of code scrolling endlessly, but it makes no sense to him.

He begins pressing keys, trying to make something happen. 
Nothing changes. The screen flickers slightly but remains unresponsive. 
He frowns, leaning closer, frustration growing with every failed attempt.

Unknown to him, hidden behind the computer, is a small button. 
A button that would enable the keyboard and give him control. 
But he doesn’t see it. He doesn’t know it’s there.
